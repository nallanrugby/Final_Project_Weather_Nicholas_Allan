Ten minute plan 


The goals of this project are to find what variables in weather interact with each other and hopefully to create weather simulator that will be able to accurately predict one of the 6 measured variables. These variables that I am using in this project are temperature, relative humidity, rainfall , wind direction, wind speed,  gust speed. To do this I am seeking to find trends between these variables. This means if one variable spikes does it affect the other variables in a repeatable pattern.  Once these trends are found I would like to use statistical analysis to calculate possible mathematical trends or equations that can begin predicting outcomes.  This will create the basses of my weather simulator and hopefully will lead me to  a more accurate answer. 


For now in my created two programs that help answer my goal of creating a simulator. the first programe creates graphs showing visual data about the variables.  the graph_maker program creates two set of graph variables versus time and variables versus temperature. this was preformed in asperation to find visual confirmation of trends or correlations between the variables. the second program creates a new dataframe that contain calaculated statiscal numbers that show the correlatoin between variables and temperature. this was preformed to find values for how the variables correlate. 

the next step of the project will hopefull consist of more complex statistical analysis that will lead to the creation of trend and the guessing of variables.
