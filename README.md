Ten minute plan 


The goals of this project are to find what variables in weather interact with each other and hopefully to create a small/short term weather simulator.   To do this I am seeking to find trends between variables. This means if one variable spikes does it affect the other variables in a repeatable pattern.  Once these trends are found I would like to use statistical analysis to calculate possible mathematical trends or equations that can begin predicting outcomes.  This will create the basses of my weather simulator and hopefully will lead me to more accurate answer.  My goals for my simulator is to be able to accurately predict one of my six measured variables. 

 
For now I need help figuring out one specific problem in one of python notebooks. This notebook in found in the bin directory named as final_project_code. 

For some reason when I try to run some statistical functions in my code I receive an error that says my variable doesn't exist but when I run plot functions that variable seems to work.  I havenâ€™t specified which variables this happens for because it seems the problem can be found through out the data frame. 

 
# Your ten minute plan gives an overview if very broad strokes, and while I know what you
are trying to accomplish, I don't really understand how you're going to accomplish it.
